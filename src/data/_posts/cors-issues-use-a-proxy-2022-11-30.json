  "body": "CORS is a safety-guard only applied on browsers. There are no CORS-errors if requesting from a server.\n\nFor serious projects, create your own proxy (by using Express, as example).\\\nFor testing, use a remote proxy.\n\nList of a few remote proxies:\n\n* [allOrigins](https://github.com/gnuns/allorigins)\n* [corsAnywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/)\n\nJust wrap your request with their proxy."
